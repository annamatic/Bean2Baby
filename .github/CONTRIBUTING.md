I'm currently seeking help in adding Tasks and To-do Lists to Bean2Baby!

**If you are a health educator, community or patient advocate, you can help develop the main Bean2Baby guide in any of these areas!**
- [ ] suggest a New Task
- [ ] suggest an Edit to an Existing Task
- [ ] suggest a Task Deletion
- [ ] suggest a New Resource

To do any of the above, click "Issue" to get started.

**Another way you could help grow Bean2Baby is to:**
- [ ] translate Bean2Baby to another language
- [ ] create a local/regional version of Bean2Baby, with contact information for your specific community
- [ ] create a specialized version of Bean2Baby, with Tasks and contact information for a particular health issue

To do any of the above, please "Fork" a copy of Bean2Baby to your own Github account!
