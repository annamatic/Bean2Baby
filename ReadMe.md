###### <a name="1"></a>What is Bean2Baby?
### Do you work for a community based organization, patient advocacy or health provider that serves pregnant and new moms? This resource is for you!
The Bean2Baby Guide consists of timeline-based To-do Lists for U.S.-based overwhelmed / under-resourced pregnant and new parents. The content is being compiled and written to focus on providing simple “bite-sized” Tasks oriented towards accessing healthcare and services and building  healthy habits, taking into account the issues that many under-resourced individuals face. [Take a look.](#2) 

This resource grew out of an idea [I proposed](https://github.com/annamatic/OpenIDEO/blob/master/maternal-health.md) for an [OpenIDEO](https://openideo.com/) challenge titled:  
**How might we reimagine the new life experience by addressing the diverse challenges of all mothers, babies, and those who care for them?** [You can read my proposal here.](https://github.com/annamatic/OpenIDEO/blob/master/maternal-health.md) [You can view the challenge and other participants' wonderful ideas here](https://challenges.openideo.com/challenge/new-life/).

###### <a name="4"></a>How is the Bean2Baby Guide organized?
### The Bean2Baby Guide is organized as follows:
- Each perinatal stage (1st Trimester, 2nd Trimester, 3rd Trimester… etc.) has single To-do List page.  
- Each To-do List page contains a list of Tasks, grouped as follows.
  - Healthy Habits (Tasks to repeat every Morning, Afternoon and Evening)
  - Week-by-Week (Tasks to focus on each week)
- The Resources Page has links to other online resources that can provide additional important information.

###### <a name="5"></a>How are Bean2Baby Tasks written?
### If you are a healthcare provider/educator or work for a non-profit community or health organization, [you are welcome to write and submit Tasks to Bean2Baby](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfTGRDsy6RN6_sZOPL-3aP_FgxCzdOuNjz-Ks-zDBpJ0A9YjA/viewform?c=0&w=1)! Here is a brief Task "style guide":
- Writing should avoid broad and passively-constructed, albeit "inspiring," wording in favor of more concrete, specific and actionable wording.
- Writing should address critical issues where users may especially lack support (such as mental health, depression, domestic violence, food deserts) and provide either direct access to a local resource via phone number or hyperlink.
- Writing should incorporate "if-then" planning, communicate simple “bite-sized” tips towards building healthy habits, routinizing regularly required behaviors and taking into account the access issues that the under-resourced often face.
- Each task should be limited to 1 action, broken into a “why,” “what” and “how.”
- Here are examples of incorrectly- and correctly- written Tasks:   
 :x: Eat a healthy diet! A balanced and nutritious diet is essential for your baby's development.    
 :white_check_mark: Pick up fruits, veggies and protein for the week so you’ll always have a nutritious snack on hand when you get hungry. Is affordable, fresh food hard to find in your area? [WIC may be able to help](http://www.womeninfantschildrenoffice.com/)
