###### What is Bean2Baby?
### Do you represent a community advocacy, patient advocacy or health organization that serves pregnant and new moms? This resource is for you!
The following pages contain timeline-based To-do Lists for U.S.-based overwhelmed / under-resourced pregnant and new parents. The content has been compiled and written to focus on providing simple “bite-sized” tips towards accessing healthcare and services and building  healthy habits, taking into account the issues that many under-resourced individuals face. Take a look:

This resource grew out of an idea I presented for an OpenIDEO challenge titled:  
**How might we reimagine the new life experience by addressing the diverse challenges of all mothers, babies, and those who care for them?** [You can view the challenge and the resulting ideas here.](#)
