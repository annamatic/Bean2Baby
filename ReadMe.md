# Introduction to Bean2Baby

**Do you represent a community advocacy, patient advocacy or health organization that serves pregnant and new moms? This resource is for you!**
The following pages contain timeline-based To-do Lists for U.S.-based overwhelmed / under-resourced pregnant and new parents. The content has been compiled and written to focus on providing simple “bite-sized” tips towards accessing healthcare and services and building  healthy habits, taking into account the issues that many under-resourced individuals face.

### Bean2Baby To-do Lists are organized as follows:
	— Each perinatal stage (1st Trimester, 2nd Trimester, 3rd Trimester… etc.) has Tasks in two groups:
		• Healthy Habits (Tasks to repeat every Morning, Afternoon and Evening)
		• Week-by-Week (Tasks to focus on each week)
	— The Resources Page has links to other online resources that can provide additional important information.

This resource grew out of an idea I presented for an OpenIDEO challenge titled:
**How might we reimagine the new life experience by addressing the diverse challenges of all mothers, babies, and those who care for them?** [You can view the challenge and the resulting ideas here.](#)
