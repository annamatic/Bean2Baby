###### <a name="1"></a>Week 00 through 04 of 40:  
It's difficult for most people to know the exact date of their pregnancy's conception. For this reason, the start of pregnancy is typically calculated from the first day of your last period (Week 00), when you’re not *actually* pregnant yet. Ovulation and conception occure sometime during Weeks 01–03. Week 04 is the week of your first missed period. Even if they were planning their pregnancy, many women don’t find out that they’re pregnant until Week 06 or later!

Nevertheless, if you are a sexually-active — regardless of whether or not you are planning for pregnancy — here are some critical things to do during and before this time:

- [ ] Do you have health insurance? If not, call 800-311-BABY (800-311-2229) *as soon as possible* to sign up for free or reduced cost prenatal healthcare in your area. [For 2018 insurance coverage, click here and sign up between November 1–December 15, 2017](https://www.healthcare.gov/). If you need assistance signing up, [localhelp.healthcare.gov](https://localhelp.healthcare.gov) might be able to help.  

- [ ] Eating healthy has never been more critical. Are you eligible for Women, Infant and Children benefits? [Find out here](https://wic.fns.usda.gov/wps/pages/start.jsf).  

- [ ] Start taking 400mcg folic acid daily. This vitamin is important for all women, but especially critical before and during pregnancy, to prevent some major birth defects of the baby’s brain and spine. [Learn more here](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/folicacid/about.html). 

- [ ] Don’t smoke, drink alcohol or do drugs. If you have an addiction, your doctor can refer you to resources to help you quit. You can also call the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration National Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP(4357) or visit [findtreatment.samhsa.gov](https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/) to be connected to a local service.

- [ ] How will you know when you're pregnant? See the ["Pregnancy Test Fact Sheet" at www.womenshealth.gov](https://www.womenshealth.gov/files/documents/pregnancy-test-fact-sheet.pdf).

###### <a name="2"></a>Healthy Habits

***Morning Tasks:*** 

- [ ] Don’t skip that breakfast! [Here are some healthy breakfast ideas.](https://www.text4baby.org/learn/pregnancy/breakfast-ideas)

- [ ] Remember to take your 400mcg of folic acid! To make sure you don’t forget, you might want to link it with an activity you automatically do every day, like brushing your teeth or having your breakfast. 

- [ ] Fill a 32 oz. bottle of water up to take with you on the go. It’s important to stay hydrated throughout the day to ensure the healthy development of your baby!

- [ ] Do you have fresh fruits, vegetables, protein and fiber on hand? If not, make a plan to pick some up today. 


***Afternoon Tasks:*** 

- [ ] Remember to stay hydrated throughout the day. Try to refill that water bottle at least 3 more times today. 


***Evening Tasks:***

- [ ] Body check. Are you peeing infrequently, is your pee dark yellow, and/or do you feel dry mouth, extreme thirst, headache or dizziness? You may not be drinking enough water. Fill up a 32.oz bottle of water to take with you on the go tomorrow, and try to empty it 4 times tomorrow!

- [ ] Week 08 of 40: "Eating for two," is a common expression, but do you know how much and what kind of food that actually is? [Enter your age and physical activity level here to see](https://www.choosemyplate.gov/MyPlate-Daily-Checklist-input).

- [ ] Week 09 of 40: It’s never too late to start healthy eating habits.

- [ ] Week 10 of 40: Morning sickness doesn't just occur in the morning. If you've been vomiting or feeling nauseous, stay hydrated, try eating small meals more often, and don't let your stomach go empty. Learn more morning sickness tips here. If you experience extreme vomiting, call your doctor.

- [ ] Week 11 of 40: Your body is changing. [Learn which changes are normal and how to reduce any discomfort you feel](https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/youre-pregnant-now-what/stages-pregnancy). If something is bothering or worrying you, don't wait to call your doctor or midwife. Sometimes physical changes can be signs of a problem.

- [ ] Week 12 of 40: When sharing your good news with coworkers, discrimination might be the last thing on your mind. But the truth is that many women are treated unfairly — or even fired — after revealing the news of their pregnancy.
