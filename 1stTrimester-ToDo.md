###### <a name="1"></a>Week 00 through 04 of 40:  
It's difficult for most people to know the exact date of their pregnancy's conception. For this reason, the start of pregnancy is typically calculated from the first day of your last period (Week 00), when you’re not actually pregnant yet. Ovulation and conception occure sometime during Weeks 01–03. Week 04 is the week of your first missed period. Even if they were planning their pregnancy, many women don’t find out that they’re pregnant until Week 06 or later.

Nevertheless, if you are a sexually-active — regardless of whether or not you are planning for pregnancy — here are some critical things to do during this time:

- [ ] Do you have health insurance? If not, call 800-311-BABY (800-311-2229) *as soon as possible* to sign up for free or reduced cost prenatal healthcare in your area. [For 2018 insurance coverage, click here and sign up between November 1–December 15, 2017](https://www.healthcare.gov/). If you need assistance signing up, [localhelp.healthcare.gov](https://localhelp.healthcare.gov) might be able to help.

- [ ] Are you eligible for Women, Infant and Children benefits? [Find out here](https://wic.fns.usda.gov/wps/pages/start.jsf)

- [ ] Start taking prenatal multivitamins daily! They will help ensure the health of your body and baby at this critical time, and they are good for your body even if it turns out that you AREN’T pregnant.

- [ ] How will you know when you're pregnant?  ["Pregnancy Test Fact Sheet" at www.womenshealth.gov] (https://www.womenshealth.gov/files/documents/pregnancy-test-fact-sheet.pdf)

###### <a name="2"></a>Healthy Habits

***Morning Tasks:*** 

- [ ] Take your prenatal vitamin daily! To make sure you don’t forget, you might want to link it with an activity you automatically do every day, like brushing your teeth or having your breakfast. 

- [ ] Fill a 32 oz. bottle of water up to take with you on the go. It’s important to stay hydrated throughout the day to ensure the healthy development of your baby!


***Afternoon Tasks:*** 

- [ ] Remember to stay hydrated throughout the day. Try to refill that water bottle at least 3 more times today. Mixing in lemon slices or fruit juices can help motivate you to keep drinking.


***Evening Tasks:***

- [ ] Body check. Are you peeing infrequently, is your pee dark yellow, and/or do you feel dry mouth, extreme thirst, headache or dizziness? You may not be drinking enough water. Fill up a 32.oz bottle of water to take with you on the go tomorrow, and try to empty it 4 times tomorrow!
